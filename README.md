# Customizable Memory Game

A customizable memory game designed for children on the autism spectrum that uses AI to generate themed images based on their special interests.

## âœ… What Works Now

- **Memory Game**: Complete - play with 3-20 card pairs
- **AI Themes**: Generate custom themes with Amazon Bedrock
- **Deployed**: Frontend and backend running on AWS
- **Local Dev**: Mock AI for testing without AWS costs

## ðŸš§ TODO

- Parent dashboard for tracking progress
- User accounts and login
- Game settings and sound controls

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
- AWS CLI configured (for deployment only)

### Quick Start (Local Development)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start frontend only (working game)
npm run dev:frontend

# Start backend locally (mock AI service)
npm run dev:backend
```

**Note:** Full deployment requires AWS permissions setup. See [README-DEPLOYMENT.md](./README-DEPLOYMENT.md) for deployment guide.

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend in development mode
npm run dev

# Start only frontend
npm run dev:frontend

# Start only backend
npm run dev:backend

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
npm run lint:fix
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (frontend + backend)
npm test

# Run frontend tests only
npm run test:frontend

# Run backend tests only
npm run test:backend

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run quick smoke tests (basic functionality check)
npm run smoke-test
```

### Testing

- Frontend: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Backend: Jest + AWS mocks
- 28 tests covering core functionality
