# AI Image Generation Implementation - Scratch Pad

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED Phase 2A: Core AI Flow
- [x] Backend generates 25 images for any theme/style
- [x] Frontend image selection UI (must select exactly 20)
- [x] Moved difficulty selection to game start screen
- [x] Updated game flow with custom images
- [x] Mock AI service working with placeholder images
- [x] Full end-to-end flow functional

## üöß NEXT STEPS: Phase 2B - Production Ready

### 1. Real AI Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Test with actual Bedrock Titan model
- [ ] Add AWS credentials configuration
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for AI failures
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed generations
- [ ] Implement generation progress tracking

### 2. Image Storage & Management (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Set up S3 bucket for production images
- [ ] Implement image resizing/optimization
- [ ] Add CDN for faster image delivery
- [ ] Image safety/content moderation
- [ ] Cleanup old/unused images

### 3. Database Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Set up DynamoDB tables in AWS
- [ ] Implement theme caching/reuse logic
- [ ] Add user authentication system
- [ ] Store user's selected image sets
- [ ] Game session persistence

### 4. UI/UX Polish (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Add CSS styling for image selector grid
- [ ] Loading states during image generation
- [ ] Image preview/zoom functionality
- [ ] Better error messaging
- [ ] Responsive design for image grid

### 5. Performance & Optimization (LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] Lazy loading for image grids
- [ ] Image compression optimization
- [ ] Caching strategies
- [ ] Bundle size optimization

### 6. Testing & Quality (ONGOING)
- [ ] Unit tests for AI generation flow
- [ ] Integration tests for full user flow
- [ ] E2E tests for image selection
- [ ] Performance testing with large image sets

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK
**Switch from mock to real Bedrock AI generation**
- Configure AWS credentials
- Test Titan image generation
- Handle real AI response format
- Add proper error handling

## üìù NOTES
- Current mock generates 25 random placeholder images
- Parent must select exactly 20 images
- Difficulty selection happens at game start (3-20 pairs)
- Images are stored in memory only (no persistence yet)
