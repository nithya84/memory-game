# Implementation Plan: Customizable Memory Game

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the Customizable Memory Game based on the PRD requirements. The project targets children on the autism spectrum with a focus on personalized, engaging memory training through AI-generated themed content.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React.js with TypeScript)
- **Game Board Component**: Dynamic grid layout supporting 3-20 card pairs
- **Card Component**: Smooth flip animations, match state management, customizable image display
- **Theme Input Interface**: Text input with real-time validation and loading states
- **Image Selection Grid**: Multi-select interface for AI-generated images with preview
- **Parent Dashboard**: Password-protected analytics and game creation panel
- **Settings Panel**: Sound controls, difficulty selection, accessibility options

### Backend (AWS Serverless)
- **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints for all game operations
- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless handlers for business logic and AI integration
- **Amazon Bedrock**: AI image generation using Titan Image Generator or Stable Diffusion
- **DynamoDB**: User profiles, saved games, analytics data, theme libraries
- **S3 + CloudFront**: Generated image storage with CDN for fast delivery

### Data Models
```
User: {
  id, email, createdAt, preferences, parentPin
}

Game: {
  id, userId, theme, images[], pairCount, createdAt, timesPlayed
}

Analytics: {
  userId, gameId, completionTime, attempts, timestamp
}
```

- Create progress tracking over time
- Add game management tools

**Accessibility & UX:**
- Implement autism-friendly design principles
- Add sound controls with volume adjustment
- Create high contrast and dark mode options
- Build onboarding tutorial with visual guides
- Implement keyboard navigation support

**Milestone:** Feature-complete MVP ready for testing

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Weeks 9-10)

#### Sprint 6 (Week 9-10)
**Quality Assurance:**
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness validation
- Performance testing with maximum card counts
- Security audit and penetration testing
- Content moderation system validation

**User Testing:**
- Conduct UAT with parents and therapists
- Gather feedback from autism community
- Iterate based on accessibility needs
- Test with actual target age group (4-12 years)

**Deployment:**
- Production environment setup
- Monitoring and alerting configuration
- Performance optimization
- Documentation completion

**Milestone:** Live application accessible to public

## Key Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- **Image Handling**: Lazy loading, WebP format, progressive enhancement
- **State Management**: React Context with useReducer for complex game state
- **API Optimization**: Debounced theme input, cached responses, batch operations
- **Rendering**: Memoized components, virtual scrolling for large grids

### Autism-Specific Design Implementation
- **Color Palette**: Soft, muted colors with customizable themes
- **Typography**: Clear sans-serif fonts with adjustable sizing
- **Interactions**: Large touch targets, clear feedback, no time pressure
- **Sounds**: Optional gentle audio cues with volume control
- **Navigation**: Consistent, predictable UI patterns

### Security & Safety Measures
- **Content Moderation**: Multi-layer filtering (Bedrock + custom rules)
- **Data Protection**: COPPA compliance, minimal data collection
- **Access Control**: Secure parent dashboard, session management
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, SQL injection prevention

### Scalability Architecture
- **Serverless Design**: Auto-scaling Lambda functions
- **Database**: DynamoDB with proper indexing for fast queries
- **CDN**: CloudFront for global image delivery
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed themes and images

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Items & Mitigation
1. **Inappropriate AI-Generated Content**
   - Use Amazon Bedrock's built-in safety filters
   - Implement custom keyword blocklist
   - Add user reporting mechanism
   - Manual review process for flagged content

2. **Performance Issues with Large Card Grids**
   - Optimize image sizes and formats
   - Implement virtual scrolling for image selection
   - Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
   - Load testing with maximum 40-card configurations

3. **Low User Engagement**
   - Early prototype testing with autism community
   - Iterative design based on user feedback
   - Focus on special interests customization
   - Simple, anxiety-free gameplay mechanics

4. **Amazon Bedrock Integration Complexity**
   - Technical spike in Week 4 for de-risking
   - Fallback to pre-generated image sets
   - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
   - Alternative AI providers as backup plan

### Dependencies & Constraints
- **AWS Services**: Bedrock availability and pricing tiers
- **Image Generation**: 2-5 second response time targets
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with CSS Grid support
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements

## Success Metrics & Monitoring

### Technical Metrics
- Image generation success rate (>95%)
- Page load times (<3 seconds)
- Game completion rates by difficulty
- API response times and error rates

### User Experience Metrics

## Post-Launch Considerations

### Immediate Priorities (Weeks 11-12)
- Monitor production performance and user feedback
- Address any critical bugs or usability issues
- Optimize based on real usage patterns
- Begin planning Phase 2 features

### Future Enhancement Roadmap
