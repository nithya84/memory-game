## Key Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- **Image Handling**: Lazy loading, WebP format, progressive enhancement
- **State Management**: React Context with useReducer for complex game state
- **API Optimization**: Debounced theme input, cached responses, batch operations
- **Rendering**: Memoized components, virtual scrolling for large grids

### Autism-Specific Design Implementation
- **Color Palette**: Soft, muted colors with customizable themes
- **Typography**: Clear sans-serif fonts with adjustable sizing
- **Interactions**: Large touch targets, clear feedback, no time pressure
- **Sounds**: Optional gentle audio cues with volume control
- **Navigation**: Consistent, predictable UI patterns

### Security & Safety Measures
- **Content Moderation**: Multi-layer filtering (Bedrock + custom rules)
- **Data Protection**: COPPA compliance, minimal data collection
- **Access Control**: Secure parent dashboard, session management
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, SQL injection prevention

### Scalability Architecture
- **Serverless Design**: Auto-scaling Lambda functions
- **Database**: DynamoDB with proper indexing for fast queries
- **CDN**: CloudFront for global image delivery
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed themes and images

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Items & Mitigation
1. **Inappropriate AI-Generated Content**
   - Use Amazon Bedrock's built-in safety filters
   - Implement custom keyword blocklist
   - Add user reporting mechanism
   - Manual review process for flagged content

2. **Performance Issues with Large Card Grids**
   - Optimize image sizes and formats
   - Implement virtual scrolling for image selection
   - Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
   - Load testing with maximum 40-card configurations

3. **Low User Engagement**
   - Early prototype testing with autism community
   - Iterative design based on user feedback
   - Focus on special interests customization
   - Simple, anxiety-free gameplay mechanics

4. **Amazon Bedrock Integration Complexity**
   - Technical spike in Week 4 for de-risking
   - Fallback to pre-generated image sets
   - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
   - Alternative AI providers as backup plan

### Dependencies & Constraints
- **AWS Services**: Bedrock availability and pricing tiers
- **Image Generation**: 2-5 second response time targets
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with CSS Grid support
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements

## Success Metrics & Monitoring

### Technical Metrics
- Image generation success rate (>95%)
- Page load times (<3 seconds)
- Game completion rates by difficulty
- API response times and error rates

### User Experience Metrics
- Theme creation completion rate
- Average session duration
- Return user percentage
- Parent dashboard engagement

### Educational Impact Tracking
- Games completed per user
- Difficulty progression over time
- Time to completion improvements
- Therapist and parent feedback scores

## Post-Launch Considerations

### Immediate Priorities (Weeks 11-12)
- Monitor production performance and user feedback
- Address any critical bugs or usability issues
- Optimize based on real usage patterns
- Begin planning Phase 2 features

## Security & Infrastructure TODOs

### 🐛 KNOWN BUGS

**1. Dev Frontend Environment Variable Not Loading**
- **Issue**: Deployed dev frontend shows 20 images instead of 3 despite `VITE_MAX_SELECTION_COUNT=3` in `.env.dev`
- **Symptoms**: Local build correctly uses `parseInt("3")` but deployed version still shows 20
- **Likely Cause**: CloudFront caching old build files or S3 deployment not updating properly
- **Fix Required**: Clear CloudFront cache or verify S3 deployment is uploading new build files
- **Priority**: HIGH - Blocking proper dev environment testing

### 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES (Phase 2B Priority)

**1. JWT Secrets in Configuration**
- **Issue**: Hardcoded JWT secrets in `backend/serverless.yml` for dev/staging environments
- **Risk**: Development secrets exposed in version control
- **Fix Required**: Move all secrets to environment variables or AWS Parameter Store
- **Priority**: HIGH - Must fix before any production deployment

**2. S3 Bucket Public Access**
- **Issue**: `deploy.sh` creates S3 buckets with `"Principal": "*"` public access
- **Risk**: Overly permissive bucket policies for production
- **Fix Required**: Implement CloudFront with Origin Access Control instead of public buckets
- **Priority**: HIGH - Security vulnerability for production

**3. CORS Configuration**
- **Issue**: CORS allows hardcoded localhost origins, not environment-specific
- **Risk**: Potential cross-origin attacks if misconfigured in production
- **Fix Required**: Environment-specific CORS origins
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Required before production

**4. Environment Variable Dependencies**
- **Issue**: Production deployment depends on manual environment variable setup
- **Risk**: Missing secrets could cause deployment failures or security gaps
- **Fix Required**: Validation checks and secure secret management
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Operational risk

### CORS Configuration Enhancement
**Current Status**: Basic localhost-only CORS setup for development
**TODO**: Implement stage-specific CORS configuration for better security:
- Dev: Allow localhost ports only (currently: 5173, 5174)
- Staging: Allow staging domain only
- Production: Allow production domain only
**Priority**: Medium - Required before production deployment

### S3 Frontend Deployment Setup
**Current Status**: S3 bucket deployment blocked by "Block Public Access" policy
**TODO**: Set up proper staging frontend deployment on S3:
1. **Configure S3 Public Access**: Disable Block Public Access for staging bucket
   ```bash
   aws s3api put-public-access-block \
     --bucket memory-game-frontend-staging \
     --public-access-block-configuration \
     "BlockPublicAcls=false,IgnorePublicAcls=false,BlockPublicPolicy=false,RestrictPublicBuckets=false"
   ```
2. **Alternative: CloudFront Distribution** (Recommended for production):
   - Create CloudFront distribution with Origin Access Control
   - Point to S3 bucket without making it public
   - Configure custom domain and HTTPS certificate
3. **Update CORS Configuration**: Allow staging S3 domain in backend CORS
4. **Test End-to-End**: Verify staging frontend on S3 connects to staging backend
**Priority**: Medium - Required for true staging environment testing

### Future Enhancement Roadmap
- Multiplayer functionality for collaborative play
- Sound-based matching games
- Text-to-speech for card names
- Community theme sharing platform
- Advanced analytics and progress reports
- Native mobile app development

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for delivering a high-quality, accessible memory game that meets the specific needs of children on the autism spectrum while leveraging modern AI capabilities for personalized learning experiences.
